# Prerequisites for All Workflow Execution

## Create Authentication Configurations
To authenticate with Concert, follow these steps:


1. **Concert API Key Authentication:**
   - Go to **Workflows > Authentications** and create an API key for Concert.
   - Provide the API key of your Concert instance.

2. **Concert Configuration Authentication:**
   - Create a Config Data for Concert.
   - Provide the following details:
     ```json
     {
       "concert_host": "test.fyre.ibm.com",         // Concert VM host URL
       "concert_port": "12443",                     // Concert VM port
       "concert_instance_id": "0000-0000-0000-0000" // Concert VM instance ID
     }
     ```
   OR in the case of using an IBM IBM Self Hub Follow the below steps

**Concert Authentication:**
   - Go to **Workflows > Authentications** and create an autherntication under the service titled IBM Self Hub

# Service Now Resilience

## Project Description
This workflow retrieves problems/incidents from ServiceNow over a specified time period, calculates the percentage of incidents (sev1 and sev2) in ServiceNow that are either resolved by change or detected by monitoring tools, and sends the processed data to the Concert Resilience evaluation API.

## Prerequisites
Once you have completed the below prerequisites, you should be ready to import and execute your ServiceNow workflow within Concert Workflows. If you encounter any issues, ensure all settings are properly configured and the necessary credentials are correct.

### 1. Upload the SBOM for your application to Concert
This will allow you to calculate metrics against the provided application.

### 2. Resilience Prerequisites
Ensure the following steps are completed before using the workflow:

- **Upload the library** which has observability NFRs (like MTTD, MTTA). Alternatively, you can use the Foundational Library, which will be automatically loaded as part of the sample data.
  
- **Create a Resilience Profile for your application:**
    1. Go to `Inventory -> Applications`.
    2. Click on your application.
    3. Navigate to `Settings`.
    4. Enable Resilience.

- **Create a Posture for your application.**

### 3. Before Importing the ServiceNow Resilience Workflow
Follow these steps:

1. Go to the **Workflow tab**.
2. Navigate to **Manage**.
3. Create a folder named `Resilience`.
4. After importing the main flow, your workflow folder hierarchy should look like the image below.

### 4. Create Authentication Configurations
- You will need to create the appropriate authentication configurations to enable secure communication between Concert and ServiceNow. This ensures that the workflow can access required resources and data during execution.

    **ServiceNow Authentication:**

    - Go to **Workflows > Authentications**` and create Bearer authentication
     Use below curl to generate and retrieve access token (for testing)

     ```bash
        curl --request POST \
       --url https://<your_service_now_instance_uri>/identity/token \
       --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
       --data grant_type=<your_grant_type> \
       --data apikey=<your_api_key> ```
       
For all other authentication types, please refer to the  [Create Authentication Configurations](#create-authentication-configurations) section.



### 5. Provide inputs to run the workflow
To determine which inputs need to be passed to your workflow, refer to the images below. Additionally, explanation is provided for some of the inputs to help you understand what each one represents.

## 4. Preparing Your Jira Mapping & Schema

Before you execute the workflow, make sure your Jira fields and the workflow schema line up.
Follow this order to avoid runtime errors:

---

### 1️⃣ Check Your Field Format Against the Schema

The workflow ships with a strict JSON schema in the variable called `incidentSchema`.  
Every field you populate in `$incident` must match the types as mentioned in the schema, for example if the schema mentions:

- **Timestamps** → `string` (ISO-8601, e.g. `2025-01-15T10:59:00.000-0500`)  
- **Durations** → `string` (minutes/hours)  
- **Arrays** → typed (`Detection_Tools_Monitoring` is an array of strings)

If you add or rename fields:

1. Extend the **mapping block** with the new labels.  
2. Add matching entries to `incidentSchema.properties` (type, description, example).  
3. Re-run the workflow to confirm the JSON Schema validation passes.

> ⚠️ **Validation:**  
> The schema is enforced at runtime — if the input value type and schema type doesn’t match, you’ll get:
>
> ```json
> {
>   "assessment_result": {
>     "status": "Error",
>     "Message": "…details from the validator…"
>   }
> }
> ```

---

### 2️⃣ Understand Where to Bind Your Jira Fields

Look at the **schema keys** (on the left) and the **corresponding field labels** in your Jira instance (on the right).  
Fill those labels in the `MAPPING FUNCTION` inside `Function_7`:

```javascript
// Schema Key                // Jira Field Label (exact as seen in your project)
$incident.Outage_Start_Time   = "Outage Start Time";   // e.g., your field is “Outage Start Time”
$incident.Outage_End_Time     = "Outage End Time";
$incident.Priority            = "Priority";
```

➡️ If someone else’s Jira uses a different label (e.g., OST instead of Outage Start Time),
update the right-hand side only:
$incident.Outage_Start_Time = "OST";

    Note:

        The schema key (left side) never changes — it’s part of the workflow.

        Only the value (right side) must match the exact label in your Jira project.

### 5. Run your Workflow
Ensure all authentication configurations and required inputs are provided before clicking on the run button on top right to start running the workflow.
