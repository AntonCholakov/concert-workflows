# Windows RDP - Certificate Auto-Remediation

## Prerequisites
To allow Ansible to communicate with a Windows Remote Desktop (RDP) machine, **Windows Remote Management (WinRM)** must be enabled.

## Setup Workflow

### 1) Import the Workflow
- Import the workflow inside the **Certificates** folder in Concert Workflows.

### 2) Create Authentication for Windows RDP in Workflows
- Choose **service** as Ansible and provide credentials inside the inventory file:

  ```ini
  [windows]
  ip_address
  [windows:vars]
  ansible_user=
  ansible_password=
  ansible_connection=winrm
  ansible_port=5985
  ansible_winrm_transport=ntlm
  ```
Replace ip_address with the Windows machine's IP address, and provide the Windows authentication credentials for ansible_user and ansible_password.
- Create an **SSH authentication** with the same credentials, which will be used for workflow renewal.Choose Service as **SSH**
  
### 3) Go to your imported workflow in Workflows section.
- Click **Run** defined under the actions tab.
- Provide the following input fields:
  - `Concert_auth` (Provide the name of concertAPI key authentication which will be created at the time of installation)
  - `Environment name`
  - `Service_auth` (Windows authentication name which is created in step 2)

# Public Access Point Discovery Workflow - OCP and Kubernetes

This workflow discovers Public Access Points for Certificates and ingests them into Concert - 

  1. For OCP:
  Using the Routes
  2. For Kubernetes:
  Using the Ingress

### Setup and Run Workflow
1. **Create OCP/Kubernetes Authentication** 
2. **Create Concert Authentication** 
3. **Provide the rest of the inputs** (described below).

5. **Save and run** the workflow.

### Inputs to the Workflow 
1. For OCP 


`concertAuth` - 

### IBM Hub - Self (Recommended)
   - Go to the **Workflows > Authentications** tab, select **IBM Hub Self** as the service, provide a name for your authentication, and click **Create**.

### IBM Concert API Key Auth in Workflows.

Host: The hostname of the VM like `concert-test.fyre.ibm.com`
API key: The API key of the Concert Instance
API Key Type: C_API_KEY for VM
Instance ID: The instance id for the Concert Instance

`serviceAuth` - OCP Auth

```
Protocol: The protocol of OCP API server like https
Host: OCP host name
Port: The port of OCP account
API Key: The API Key of the OCP account
```

`envName` - Enivronment name to ingest data in Concert like `"prod"`,`"test"`

`apiServer` - API Server of the cluster

`systemType` - It indicates weather workflow is to be executed for OCP or Kubernetes. It is an enum input with values `"ocp"`, `"kubernetes"`. For OCP value will be `"ocp"`

**All the above inputs are mandatory for both OCP and Kubernetes Workflow execution.**

Optional Input - 

`namespaces` - Array of Namespaces for which Public Access Point is to be discovered in OCP.

2. For Kubernetes

`concertAuth` - IBM Concert API Key Auth in Workflows.

Same as above

`serviceAuth` - Kubernetes Auth

```
Protocol: The protocol of Kubernetes API server like https
Host: Kubernetes host name
API Key: The API Key of the Kubernetes account
```

`envName` - Enivronment name to ingest data in Concert like `"prod"`,`"test"`

`apiServer` - API Server of the cluster

`systemType` - It indicates weather workflow is to be executed for OCP or Kubernetes. It is an enum input with values `"ocp"`, `"kubernetes"`. For Kubernetes value will be `"kubernetes"`

Optional Input - 

`namespaces` - Array of Namespaces for which Public Access Point is to be discovered in OCP.


NOTE - If no namespaces([]) or empty namespace([""]) is given as input to the workflow, then workflow will discover public access points for all the namespaces.

### After configuring all the necessary input variables and authentication details, save the workflow.
#### Click Run to execute the workflow.
After the execution of the Workflow, the certificates with public access points will be ingested to Concert. The certificates will be available at `Dimension > Operation` tab

# Discover Certificates Using Network Scan

This workflow discovers Certificates from open ports of network scan and ingests them into Concert - 


### Setup and Run Workflow
1. **Create Ansible Authentication** 
2. **Create Concert Authentication** 
3. **Provide the rest of the inputs** (described below).
4. **Save and run** the workflow.

### Inputs to the Workflow 

`concertAuth` - Hub Self Auth of IBM Concert

`ansibleAuth` - Authentication of Ansible VM.

`envName` - Enivronment name to ingest data in Concert like `"prod"`,`"test"`

`portArray` - Array of the ports to be scanned.

NOTE - If no port is provided as input then the workflow will scan for all the open ports.

### After configuring all the necessary input variables and authentication details, save the workflow.
#### Click Run to execute the workflow.
After the execution of the Workflow, the certificates after network scan will be ingested to Concert. The certificates will be available at `Dimension > Operation` tab
